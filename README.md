# Arduino
Some of the arduino projects I have tooled around with in the past

## Weather Station
This is a small project to make a stand alone sensor and http server for getting info about the current climate info from wherever the sensor is located.

## httpServer
Very simple IoT server used on the ESP8266 Arduino module. Website is based off of example.com

## IoTLight
Based off of the httpServer except it includes a led switch. used on the ESP8266 Arduino module. Website is based off of example.com

## IoTSensorAndLight
Combines the weather station project and the IoT light to show the humidity and temperature of the surrounding area as well as allow for the led light switch to be toggled on and off.
